Woke up with this melody. From a dream? I forget. Wrote some words. Most of them crap. We really enjoy the “will I ever” mantra that emerged. Decided to leave the original melody in as an intro. I remember [Ran Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_Blake) or [Hankus Netski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hankus_Netsky) explaining years ago that in gospel music it’s common for the entire “song” to take up a small percentage of a piece of music: the balance being extrapolations. It’s a waltz-mantra. As I write, Emilio’s learning the into melody on the violin. Sounding awesome. He’s tired and we’re all a little hurt since finding out the band Teresa’s out on the road with had their van and gear stolen when they were getting coffee in San Antonio today. A Baltimore band. With an androgynous female singer. [Lower Dens](http://lowerdens.com/).

### Sisterhood of Man

There’s a really amusing and inspiring

Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo
Wahay Guru Sat Nam Hare Hare Ram Ram
Getting Better All The Time

### All Human

A whole queerchestra!

Incomplete Faith
Long Ek Ong Car
Oh, Lead
Shatter the Mold
Gobinday

From ridiculous to beautiful and back again.
