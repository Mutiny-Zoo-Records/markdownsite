![](https://giggleoutloud.com/LIVE/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/hornedowl-300x300.jpg)How awesome that our old, deal friend John Siket is here for a stay. The Mouse Hole–the studio here at Temple of Wow–has been set up in one form or another for years, but always in a fairly liminal state. [Liminal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liminal) is a really cool word that means it’s still forming. Our friend and really cool Pensacola gardener Jen Chendea recently turned us on to it. Liminal is a step closer to manifestation than subliminal. There is something about liminality in art that has always engaged me. Maybe the greatest art is always liminal.

John has been recording and mixing music from Phish to Sonic Youth for decades and he’s encouraged us to finally hang our speakers properly. John said we should look up this [little Tape-Op article about Carl Tatz Studio Design](http://tapeop.com/reviews/gear/82/phantomfocus-system/) for reference and I wanted to mark it for future reference as well.

### It’s the Future, July 2020

We renovated the Cente

Our powered Event 20/20 near field monitors have the tweeter 12″ from the base and since we’re laying them on their sides, we want the front corners 67.5″ minus 24″ apart: 43.5″. They won’t hang directly below the corresponding hooks, which will be a few inches outside of the geographic boundaries of the hanging wooden platforms themselves.
